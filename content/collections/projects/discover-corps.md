Discover Corps — an international, purpose-driven travel company — desperately need a facelift and some technical improvements on their lead generation site. I built as a custom WordPress theme and allowed Discover Corps to utilize significant site speed improvements, a unique modern design, and improved customer experience.

{{responsive src="statamic://asset::remote::projects/discover-corps/discover-corps_cottontail-portfolio_mockup-4.jpg" alt="Discover Corps mobile website views" glide:width="1024"}}

The design not only helped Discover Corps improve their user experience with updated, responsive designs it also improved the crucial page-speed performance of the site. WordPress can be notorious for slow page loading times with mountains of plugins and poorly developed themes, but I took extra care to ensure that the custom WordPress theme was carefully developed. The site came with everything it needed and nothing it didn’t which gave it high marks on page-speed benchmarks for both mobile, and desktop.
