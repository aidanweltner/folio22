[Pronghorn Advisors](http://pronghornadvisors.com/) is a strategic consulting company based in Bozeman, MT. Pronghorn provides strategic plans, funding solutions, and program management to businesses and non-profits around the area. I worked with Pronghorn to come up with a name for the business, a brand, a few marketing materials and the website. I also provide creative services for Pronghornâ€™s client list and we are currently working on one project together with the [Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators](http://agaimt.com/).

_2022 Note: Lara is a good friend who worked with me on [ShareLift](/projects/sharelift). Her business isn't really active, but I like the branding and it led to the creation of my company, [Cottontail Creative](https://cottontailcreative.com)._

## Branding
The brand for Pronghorn Advisors started with the naming process. The Pronghorn is widely regarded as an animal which is resilient, elegant and intelligent; perfect for a strategy consulting business. The silhouette of the pronghorn itself made for a perfect logo.

## Marketing Materials
I designed business cards and a powerpoint template for Pronghorn to go along with the strong colors and striking logo to give striking handouts for clients and presentations.

## Website
The website built on a simple, one-page design that matched up with the colors of the brand and the underlying ideas of elegance and intelligence behind the logo. [Visit it here](http://pronghornadvisors.com/).
