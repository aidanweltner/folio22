VERTICAL Construction is a small general contractor in Boise, ID. I originally did a web design overhaul, developed a new site and led a branding and logo refresh in 2017. The 2017 site was built in WordPress on the popular Divi theme, which was modified slightly. I refreshed the site again in 2020 with a much faster, more modern NextJS build. The repository is public and [can be viewed here](https://github.com/aidanweltner/vertical-next).

[Read a more detailed case study](https://cottontailcreative.com/project/vertical-construction-web-design/) about the 2020 rebuild.

Vertical is my Dad's company so I get free reign on the design and I get to tweak it often. We often have meetings around the dinner table or at the bar. Payment was taken in the form of college living expense assistance, so it's a very expensive website.
