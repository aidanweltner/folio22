## The Foundation
_Note: this portfolio project was originally published in 2015 but I still cite much of my career and confidence to One Stone and many of my peers remain some of my closest friends._

[One Stone](https://onestone.org) was a formative part of my role as a leader, a creator and an empowered entrepreneur. I owe it to the organization for my confidence in starting my business, ShareLift, as well as my own freelance practice in the creative field. One Stone is a student-led non-profit (501c3) with the mission of empowering students to be better leaders and making the world a better place. When I was at the organization, I worked on various projects that addressed the needs of Wildland Firefighters, students affected by bullying, fundraising for the organization and many more. I served on the board of directors as the Vice Chair and as a founding member and the executive director of [Two Birds Creative Studio](https://onestone.org/two-birds-creative-studio). Two Birds is one of the revenue generating creative services arm of One Stone that provides ad-agency-caliber work for various businesses and non-profits around Boise and the treasure valley.

## Noteworthy Projects
### YMCA/Explore Camp
The YMCA/Explore Camp video was a promotion for the Explore Camp program which was geared at getting kids at risk of nutritionally related health problems thinking about healthy lifestyle habits. [Nate Stranzl](https://www.natestranzl.com/) and I collaborated on the video to create something that captured the vibe at camp and conveyed to viewers the mission of the program.

### Fundraising Videos
I had the experience to make various fundraising videos for One Stone with the rest of the Two Birds teams. The “I + WE” concept was one of our strongest.

I never shy away from a silly video concept.
