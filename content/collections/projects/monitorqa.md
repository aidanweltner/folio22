monitorQA, a SaaS startup, needed a new site to be the backbone of their online marketing and product feature showcase. The site was built as a custom WordPress theme with a unique design that set them apart from their competitors and matched with the design system they used for their app.

This was one of my favorite projects in the last few years and what I spent a lot of my time working on during the pandemic. My contact at the company, Andrew, has invited me to work with him on a number of other projects.
