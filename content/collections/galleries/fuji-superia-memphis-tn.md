Here's some highlights from a roll of film I shot this fall. I loaded a roll of Fujifilm Superia 400 in my Ilford Sprite 35II when we were staying in NW Arkansas for a Razorbacks Football game (late September) but didn't really take any pictures until we met my parents in Memphis (early October) for a short weekend get away. I've been using the Ilford Sprite a lot because it's small, easy to use, and takes those classic disposable camera photos with whatever film I chose to load in. Scanning "drugstore" films like Superia can always be tricky because the film itself is flimsier than professional-grade films and tends to curve after it's dried. You'll notice some newton rings in a few frames from were I couldn't get the film flat enough during the scan. I love how some of these shots turned out. I think they do a great job of highlighting a few fun moments from these trips.
