meta_description: 'I took one of my favorite cameras on a road trip across England & Scotland and captured some black and white photos on Kodak Tri-X.'

Here's a few highlights from a roadtrip in England and Scotland. I brought my trusty Olympus OM-1n and my Zuiko 35mm f/2 lens along with some black and white film and a few color filters. I brought the black and white film because I was expecting gray, dull weather but of course we had sunshine the whole trip. I ended up using the orange (86b) filter a lot and it made for some nice extra detail in the blue skies. I also brought my digital camera but I'm not sure I even took a single photo on it which has been typical lately. I have started to bring either a digital camera or a film camera and I end up still taking a lot of photos on my iPhone. I suppose the best camera is the one you have with you. I didn't take as many photos as I would have liked this trip since we did so much driving so you'll have to take my word at how beautiful it was. I also snuck a few photos from back at home onto this roll since I didn't finish it on the trip.
