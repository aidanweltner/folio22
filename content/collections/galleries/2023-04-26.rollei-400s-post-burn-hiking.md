I took one of my favorite cameras out for a little hike outside Little Rock and ran almost an entire roll of Rollei Retro 400S through it. Trail crews had just done some seasonal burning on the underbrush and the contrast between the charred soil and the leafless hardwoods was awesome. I loved the way these shots turned out. I also slipped a few frames in from life around town.
