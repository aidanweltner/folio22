I have finally set aside some time to work on the design refresh of my personal website again. Today I decided to tackle arguably the most important part of the site (at least to me). I came up with this design for a slider that showcases all of my daily creations, like this one. It’s a simple little component that will dynamically update when I publish new content and I am pretty excited about it. You can see it in the context of the rest of the site below. I am not sure I am crazy about the rest of the design yet — I’ve been battling with how I actually want the header to be laid out — but I really like the way this little slider turned out.
