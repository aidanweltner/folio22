**[Sharpen](https://sharpen.design/) Prompt:** Create a nav menu for a private security firm. **Time limit:** 15 mins

I tried to create a simple color scheme, layout, and text layout that inspires quick action. I really like the results!

### About Sharpen:
Sharpen is a simple idea generator for quick design challenges for branding, marketing, and product/ux. I open it up in the morning on days when I don’t feel like working or I don’t feel particularly inspired. I find that limiting myself to quick 10-25min challenges kickstarts my day and gets my brain moving. I use the same idea generation approach when I am working on my personal projects.
