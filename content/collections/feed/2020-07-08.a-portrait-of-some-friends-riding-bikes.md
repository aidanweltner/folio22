I went for a bike ride yesterday and snapped a few photos at the top of the trail as we were watering up and preparing for the decent. The evening light up in the meadow was incredible and made these portraits really pop. I am still blown away with how easy it is to carry my camera with me in my new riding bag. It makes me take so many more pictures so much more often.
