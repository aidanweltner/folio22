I had the opportunity to jump out on a lunch ride with some friends on a quick loop here in Bozeman. Luke and Jenna are moving to Arizona this weekend and they’re great at posing for pictures, so I snapped a few of them at the top of the decent. I got a new [hip bag from Pack NW](http://packnw.com/all-products/ridgeline-roll-top) that makes it easier for me to carry my camera around on bike rides so I’ve been taking a lot more pictures with my little [Fuji XT2](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t2/) that I dearly love. You can check out a regularly updated stream of my photos over on [my Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aidanweltner/).
