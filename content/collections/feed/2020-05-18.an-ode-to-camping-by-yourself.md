Over the weekend I made a mad dash to go camping by myself. I have been having a very stimulating few weeks with all the quarantine madness and I needed some alone time and quiet space. I drove out to some areas that I have been eyeing up on the map for hunting and found a nice spot after driving down a few dirt roads that unfortunately did not end up where I thought they would. I got to listen to some podcasts, turn my phone off, explore some mining towns and, of course, take some pictures. I followed this up with meeting some friends for another night of camping. We were celebrating one of my best friendâ€™s birthdays. We had plans to go to Mexico this spring but COVID lockdowns got in the way so we had a Mexico-themed birthday camp and did a few awesome mountain bike rides. All in all, some very needed R&R.
