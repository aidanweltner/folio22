I wanted to create a product listing card for a used bicycle exchange website with some nice hover effects. I used [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) to design the layout and animations. Itâ€™s becoming one of my favorite tools in my workflow since it has an interface for many effects I use on the web like repeating grids, hover states, and global colors. I limited myself to 30 mins for the design but I spend a little extra time outputting the GIF to demonstrate the animation.
