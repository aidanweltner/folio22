(mockups)

I took a quick stab at a new UI and design theme for my personal website and portfolio (the site that you’re on right now). I wanted to experiment with a few things: 1) a warm-grey color pallet to continue to include my signature orange accent color, 2) a mix between organic and geometric shapes, and 3) a design more centered around my [FCOD](/categories/creative) (first creation of the day, like this) posts. With the portfolio update on the site, I also plan to use and experiment with a few new technologies. I am beginning to dive into the [Tailwind CSS framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) which I plan to use to layout this site. Unfortunately, it doesn’t natively support this particular color scheme that I am after. I also plan to build this site on either the [Sage Starter Theme](https://roots.io/sage/) framework for WordPress or build this site as a headless site in the [Frontity React Framework](https://frontity.org/). I am obsessed with the idea of using a monospace font and a more modern serif font for my portfolio, for obvious developer bonus-points. I decided to go with Sofia Pro and Odisseia. I got inspiration from [Filip Justić on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/11474719-PlusImpact-Hero-Exploration), [Iñaki Soria‘s personal site](https://inakisoria.com/), and [Sarah Dayan‘s personal site](https://sarahdayan.dev/). I like the design (desktop on the left, mobile on the right), but I will likely continue to wrestle with it for the next few weeks. Besides, this is just a starting point!
