My Grandma sends Christmas money every year and I wanted to send out a nice little update about what I had been up to for the last year in the form of some photographs of my travels, gatherings and otherwise. I included some photos of me from my trip to Maine and mountain biking around Bozeman. I added some photos of my truck and a camp spot on my road trip through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada earlier this year. I included some photos with friends at a Thanksgiving party, riding bikes in the Beartooth Mountains, and a mountain biking trip to New Zealand. All the photographs had nice little hand-written captions on the back and I included a letter with a summary of my travels and accomplishments. I gave myself 30 minutes to complete the task but I got carried away and it took much longer. So it goes!
