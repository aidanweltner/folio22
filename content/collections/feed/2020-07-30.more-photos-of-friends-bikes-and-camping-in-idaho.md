I had the opportunity to take a nice weekend trip down to Idaho with some good friends this past weekend for some camping and mountain biking. We went to an are that I spent a lot of time as a kid and it felt great to be back in a place that I love, with some people that I love, doing activities that I deeply love. All in all, amidst a point history that feels very tumultuous and scary, I find myself reflecting on how lucky I am to be able to make space for myself and those I care about. Getting to run off to the mountains for a few days during an otherwise incredibly stressful time is an immense privilege and I am so grateful for it. I hope that others are making space for themselves as well. We all need it.
