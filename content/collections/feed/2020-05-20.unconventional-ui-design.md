I did a quick [Sharpen prompt](https://sharpen.design/) this morning after a few client phone calls and email responses. The prompt was to create a scheduling app for [Tupac Shakur](https://2pac.com/us), the infamous rapper. It’s a super fun prompt and I definitely had a smile on my face the whole time. I went for a super simple UI and a simple monochrome color scheme as an homage to the black & white photos that often adorn his album covers. I used the [Matrix II font](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/matrix-ii) as a tip of the hat to 90’s hip-hop aesthetics. Thanks to designers [Adrien Coquet](https://thenounproject.com/coquet_adrien/) and [mikicon](https://thenounproject.com/mikicon/) on the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) for the icons. I gave myself 15 minutes for this design but I ended up taking a little over 30 for the design and the mockup.

### About Sharpen:
Sharpen is a simple idea generator for quick design challenges for branding, marketing, and product/ux. I open it up in the morning on days when I don’t feel like working or I don’t feel particularly inspired. I find that limiting myself to quick 10-25min challenges kickstarts my day and gets my brain moving. I use the same idea generation approach when I am working on my personal projects.
