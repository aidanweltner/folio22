I really like the design for the homepage of one of my clients, [The Residences at 132 Main](https://132mainresidences.com). I created a few mockups for both the mobile and desktop versions of the site on some nice Apple devices. The mockups I used include, a dark mode desktop google chrome mockup by Dmitry Sidenko, a MacBook mockup from Pixeden, and an iPhone mockup from Mockup World. These mockups were also my first posts on my Dribble account!
