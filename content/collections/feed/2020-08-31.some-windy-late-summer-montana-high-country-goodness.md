I always used to watch nature videos as a kid when I was stressing about school. Just raw audio and video, nothing fancy. When I take a break to watch something like this with the intention to calm down and lower my blood pressure it generally does the trick.

I so often carry professional video equipment with me when I’m bopping around and exploring, I think it’s wise to start making my own little ASMR nature videos.

Here’s one from a solo romp in the Montana high country. Turn your sound on for decently recorded wind noises. Go full screen and give the 4k version some time to buffer for a more immersive experience.

I’m very seriously considering starting to license some stock video and photography. I think that backcountry nature clips would definitely be my specialty. As I said, I often have the equipment with me anyways!
