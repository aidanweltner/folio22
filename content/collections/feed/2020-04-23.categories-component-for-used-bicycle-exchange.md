I’m back on designing more for this theoretical used-bicycle exchange. This time I wanted to bust something out real quick. I gave myself a time limit of 15 minutes. I took a crack at the categories header for listings. Again, trying to stick with a simple, but effective layout. Again, I used Adobe XD for the layout and the animations.
