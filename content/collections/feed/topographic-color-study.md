This is just a quick study in some earth tones and a new process that I am working on to produce graphic from topographical data. I really like the color combos and the way the color slightly graduates in the topographic lines.

About the topographic design tools:
I use a combination of a [contour SVG generator](https://contourmapcreator.urgr8.ch/) from a Swiss developer, [Christoph Hofstetter](https://ch.urgr8.ch/), for the actual data and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) to make the topographic designs. Itâ€™s a super cool process for me because I really love maps and incorporating the places I love in my designs. This data happens to come from [Bridger Bowl Ski Area](https://bridgerbowl.com/) here in Bozeman.
